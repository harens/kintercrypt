*An easy-to-use encryption program, built from the ground up*

*⚠️ This project is for educational purposes only. It is by no means complete or secure! ⚠️*

## Features

* Encrypts and decrypts text quickly
* Simple GUI interface
* Cross-platform support
* Extensive in-code comments and docstrings to explain how various ciphers/codecs work
* Written in pure Python with no dependencies required to run the program, making it trivial to install

## Installation

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/harens/kintercrypt/releases)

Alternatively, to build from source, download the source code from [here](https://github.com/harens/kintercrypt/archive/master.zip) and run [`kintercrypt/main_gui.py`](https://github.com/harens/kintercrypt/blob/master/kintercrypt/main_gui.py)

## Why?

Other than for testing and deployment, this project has _zero_ third-party dependencies. What you see in the source code is what you get as a program.

Not only does this improve longer-term stability and portability, but from a security standpoint, the project is more reliable and easier to analyse.

From an educational viewpoint, this makes it easier to learn from the code how to implement various cryptographic ciphers.
